Small, thin flan of bronze. No decoration evident on either obverse or reverse.

Additional Notes:  Identified as a coin when excavated. The weight, however, does not correspond to any Republican denomination. At less than a gram, it is still too light for the very small half-litra denomination, of which Crawford identifies a single issue RRC 26/4 (234-231 BCE).  Despite this, given the longevity of use for the other coins found in this context, it is possible that this piece of bronze was used in a manner similar to small denominations of bronze and functioned as currency based solely on its weight.",Coin

Head of Apollo, fillet not visible, right. Border of dots.
Poorly preserved. Left back leg, underside, and right foreleg of animal, walking right, discernible. 

Notes: Obverse type resembles BM 1889,1106.139 with respect to the arrangement of hair on the top of the head and the shape of the nose. However, arrangement of hair above the brow differs. The deity is perhaps wearing a laurel or other type of vegetal crown. The obverse was also struck off flan, obscuring the hair at the nape of the neck. A secure identification is further complicated by corrosion on the obverse. 
The stance of the animal on the reverse resembles the arrangement of the walking lions on RRC 16/1a. 
If the identification is correct, the weight is above average for the double litra but within the weight range for this denomination.

Additional Notes: Due to the state of preservation, it is not possible to provide a more secure reference, but this coin can be confidently linked with either 17/1a and 17/1c, which differ in their arrangement of the reverse legend. Few types pair a helmeted deity with a horse’s head. As recorded by Crawford, 17/1a and 17/1c are the only types to feature a left facing, helmeted and beardless deity.
The diameter and weight corresponds well with the measurements for this denomination and type.

This stamp is very beaten up but seems to be similar to Oxe, A., Comfort, H. 2000. Potter number 991, IVLIVS.

Oxe, Comfort suggests that approximate date is 10 BCE to 10 AD and with the location as Pozzuoli on plain ware.This sherd is unslipped and strange on the backside of the piece, perhaps that is what they mean by plain ware. -Mercedes Sisk, 2017 ",Stamp

His left hand is just visible behind his torso, grasping the woman's right calf with her right foot under his armpit. His chin is pointed down toward his chest. The woman reclines with her legs up as previously described. Part of her torso and right breast are preserved, as is her right arm, which stretches upward and behind her head, of which only a small bit of hair remains. A piece of cloth is visible beneath the man's feet. At the far left of the sherd is the end of a possible inscription, with only the final V"" or ""Y"" visible.

Conservation treatment 6th July 2017
Two Amber fragments with degraded surface removed from soil. Surface actively laminating off object.
Amber examined under a microscope and dry brushed lightly.
One Amber fragment left unconsolidated for provenance testing.
Larger Amber fragment with possible shaped round edges consolidated with paraloid b72 (unknown percentage but less than 20) in acrtone through immersion. Object left in paraloid until no more bubbles appeared. Excess paraloid removed with acetone and left to air dry.
Both fragments wrapped in tin foil and sealed in an unpierced box. Flakes of Amber also kept with the fragments in an unpierced bag.

Recommendations: Amber must be kept out of direct light and at a stable relative humidity (45-60% outer limit, ideally 50-55%) to prevent drying out and cracking.",Unknown

Lab notes: long, tubular piece of worked bone. One surface is worked flat, but is still rough with tool marks. The top is convex, smoothed and polished. Both ends are worked. One end is vertical, rough with tool marks. The other ends is pointed and shaped to a ~45 degree angle like a miter joint. Seems likely that the bone was used as molding to frame other decoration, with only 1 surface intended to be visible.
