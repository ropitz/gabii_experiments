# gabii_experiments

 * Access the Jupyter notebooks in this repository to try out some experimental ways of exploring the stratigraphic data from Gabii. These Jupyter notebooks are designed to allow you to run code in your web browser without installing any software. 
 
 * How do you do it? Click 'launch binder' (go make a cup of coffee and wait while the software environment builds) and then click the notebook (.ipynb file) you want to use to get started. 
 
 * Run each command in the notebook by clicking in a cell and hitting 'ctrl+enter' or choose 'cell' and then 'run all' from the top menu to run the whole notebook.

# Notebooks for exploring Gabii Stratigraphic Matrix Data
*  'gabii_matrix_web.ipynb' - This notebook is set up to explore stratigraphic relationships within Area C and visualize different parts of the matrix. This tool is complementary to the y-ed software currenly in use. 

* Gabii Kobo API is an experiment in merging the current and in-development data collection workflows, as if the current one was legacy, and the in-development one was live.
